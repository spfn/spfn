/**
 * Publish every packages/* version the private Gitea registry does not have yet,
 * in an order that puts each package after the ones it depends on.
 *
 * Runs in Woodpecker on a main push (see .woodpecker/publish.yml). The registry
 * itself is the idempotency guard: a version already published is skipped, so
 * re-running the pipeline is safe and a push that changed a package.json without
 * bumping the version publishes nothing.
 *
 * The order matters because registry versions are immutable. `readdirSync`
 * order would let a package go out while a sibling it declares a dependency on
 * is still absent, and that version can never be made installable afterwards —
 * only replaced, with everyone who resolved it in between keeping the broken
 * one. So the run is ordered by `scripts/lib/publish-order.mjs`, and the order
 * is then checked rather than trusted: before each publish, every internal
 * dependency's target version has to be on the registry already or to have gone
 * out earlier in this same run.
 *
 * The channel comes from the version string the same way the GitHub npmjs
 * workflows derive it: `-alpha` -> alpha, `-beta` -> beta, otherwise latest.
 * The actual publish goes through scripts/publish-package.mjs, which also moves
 * the `latest` dist-tag onto the published version.
 *
 * Auth is the caller's job: an .npmrc mapping the @spfn scope to the Gitea
 * registry with a token must exist before this runs.
