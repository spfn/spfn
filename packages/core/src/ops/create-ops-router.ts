/**
 * Ops Router
 *
 * The structure half of SPFN's CLI-first operations surface. An app develops
 * its own ops as ordinary routes — domain operations only that app can name —
 * and this factory turns them into a mountable package router that:
 *
 * - requires every route to come from `opsRoute`, which applies the `/_ops`
 *   namespace, so the surface is recognizable and an ops route can never
 *   shadow an app route;
 * - injects the given auth middleware into every route, the manifest
 *   included, so an unauthenticated ops surface cannot be created by
 *   accident — there is no opt-out;
 * - serves `GET /_ops/_manifest`, the self-description the `spfn ops` CLI
 *   discovers commands from, registered first so no app route takes its URL.
 *
 * What the path looks like after the namespace is the app's business, decided
 * when the ops route is written — this factory does not audit its shape.
 *
 * The auth middleware itself lives with the app's auth stack (`@spfn/auth`
 * ships `opsTokenAuth`); core owns only the structure, so the ops surface has
 * no opinion about how a token is stored or verified.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createOpsRouter, opsRoute } from '@spfn/core/ops';
 * import { opsTokenAuth, requireOpsScope } from '@spfn/auth/server';
 *
 * export const opsRouter = createOpsRouter({
 *     listSignups: opsRoute.get('/signups')            // GET /_ops/signups
 *         .use([requireOpsScope('waitlist:read')])
 *         .handler(async () => signupsRepository.list()),
 * }, { auth: opsTokenAuth });
 *
 * // mounted like any package router:
 * export const appRouter = defineRouter({ ... }).packages([opsRouter]);
 * ```
