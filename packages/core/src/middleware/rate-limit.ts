/**
 * @spfn/core - Rate limit middleware
 *
 * Fixed-window rate limiter, registered under the named 'rateLimit' middleware
 * so routes can opt out with `.skip(['rateLimit'])`.
 *
 * Counters live in the shared cache (ioredis) when one is configured: a single
 * atomic Lua call does the increment and the window expiry, so concurrent
 * requests cannot race between INCR and PEXPIRE, and every instance counts
 * against the same window.
 *
 * With no cache — or with the cache down — the limiter counts **in this
 * process** instead (`MemoryRateLimitStore`), the same in-memory-default shape
 * the clientProofV1 replay ledger and the SSE token manager use. Per-process
 * counters mean the effective limit multiplies by the instance count, which is
 * worse than Redis and much better than the alternative that used to apply:
 * having nowhere to count, and so either passing everything through or
 * refusing everything. `failClosed` is what asks for the strict reading —
 * refuse rather than count locally — and stays off by default.
