 * different port says so once here instead of repeating the number across its
 * `server.config.ts`, Dockerfile, compose file, `next.config.ts` and env
 * example, where nothing checks that the copies still agree.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of side effects. `@spfn/core/config`
 * validates the whole environment schema the moment it is imported, which is
 * fine inside a server and wrong inside a CLI that has not been handed an
 * app's environment yet.
