/**
 * Bounded SSE outbound writer
 *
 * Serializes writes to one SSE stream through a single drain loop that `await`s
 * each `writeSSE` — so a slow client applies real backpressure instead of letting
 * frames pile up unbounded in memory (OOM under a fast producer + slow consumer).
 *
 * The queue is per-connection, so a slow stream never blocks other connections.
 * When the queue exceeds `maxQueue`, the connection is closed (via `onClose`)
 * rather than silently dropping frames — dropping a chunk would corrupt an
 * ordered token/chat stream; the client reconnects and re-fetches instead.
