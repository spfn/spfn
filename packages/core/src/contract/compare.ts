/**
 * Backward-compatibility comparison
 *
 * Compares the contract a build produces against the newest released snapshot.
 *
 * The rule that shapes everything here: **optional runs in opposite directions
 * on the two sides.** A request is safe when the server grows more tolerant —
 * a new optional field, a dropped field, a requirement relaxed. A response is
 * safe when the server grows more certain — a new field, a value that used to
 * be optional now always present. Collapsing both into one rule would
 * necessarily get one of them backwards.
 *
 * | change                  | request | response |
 * |-------------------------|---------|----------|
 * | field added (optional)  | pass    | pass     |
 * | field added (required)  | refuse  | pass     |
 * | field removed           | pass    | refuse   |
 * | required → optional     | pass    | refuse   |
 * | optional → required     | refuse  | pass     |
 * | type changed            | refuse  | refuse   |
