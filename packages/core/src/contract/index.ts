/**
 * Route contracts
 *
 * A contract is what a route promises to clients that are compiled and
 * deployed separately from the server. This module collects those promises from
 * a loaded router, writes them to `contracts/current.json`, and refuses a build
 * whose changes would break an already-released client.
