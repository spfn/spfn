/**
 * Contract Collection
 *
 * Walks a loaded router and turns every route carrying `.contract()` into a
 * contract operation.
 *
 * The router is loaded and walked rather than parsed from source. Real routes
 * build their schemas from imported values — `EmailSchema`, `FileSchema()`,
 * `KEY_DEVICE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH` — which a source parser cannot resolve. Loading
 * costs a module import and no infrastructure: route modules have no
 * import-time side effects, so nothing here opens a database connection.
