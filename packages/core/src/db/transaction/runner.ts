/**
 * Transaction Runner
 *
 * Standalone transaction execution utility for scripts, migrations, and CLI commands.
 * Provides the same transaction management capabilities as the Transactional middleware
 * but without Hono dependency.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Automatic transaction management (start/commit/rollback)
 * - Transaction propagation via AsyncLocalStorage
 * - PostgreSQL-level timeout with automatic rollback guarantee
 * - Execution time tracking and slow transaction warnings
 * - UUID-based transaction IDs for debugging
 *
 * Timeout Implementation:
 * Uses PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL statement_timeout` to ensure database-level timeout
 * enforcement. This guarantees that long-running transactions are actually rolled
 * back at the database level, preventing data inconsistency.
 *
 * Nesting:
 * A call made while another transaction is already open on the async call chain
 * takes a SAVEPOINT on that transaction's connection instead of opening a second
 * one. Nested calls made off the same transaction run one at a time, because
 * their savepoints share that connection. Pass `requiresNew: true` to opt out
 * and get an independent transaction on a connection of its own.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { runInTransaction } from '@spfn/core/db';
 * import { users } from './schema';
 *
 * // Simple usage
 * const user = await runInTransaction(async (tx) => {
 *   const [user] = await tx.insert(users).values({ name: 'John' }).returning();
 *   return user;
 * });
 *
 * // With options
 * await runInTransaction(
 *   async (tx) => {
 *     await tx.insert(users).values({ name: 'Jane' });
 *     await tx.insert(profiles).values({ userId: 1 });
 *   },
 *   {
 *     context: 'migration:add-user',
 *     timeout: 60000,
 *     slowThreshold: 2000,
 *   }
 * );
 * ```
