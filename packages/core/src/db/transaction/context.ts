/**
 * Create the gate that serializes one context's nested (SAVEPOINT) frames
 *
 * Sibling savepoints are two frames on ONE connection, and `ROLLBACK TO` unwinds
 * the connection — not a branch of it. Left concurrent, a sibling that fails
 * discards every row the other sibling wrote after its savepoint was taken, and
 * the surviving sibling reports success. So a frame opens only once the frame
 * queued before it has closed — returned, or unwound with ROLLBACK TO — which
 * puts each sibling's writes strictly inside its own savepoint again.
 * `Promise.all` over nested calls keeps working; it just stops overlapping.
 *
 * The gate belongs to the context the frames are opened off, NOT to the root, so
 * it never blocks depth: a frame holds its PARENT's gate while its own gate —
 * fresh, uncontended — serializes its children. `requiresNew` takes no gate at
 * all; it runs on its own connection, where nothing interleaves.
 *
 * The one shape this cannot save is a frame that awaits a sibling queued BEHIND
 * it: the waiter holds the gate, so the sibling it waits for never opens, and no
 * statement is running for a timeout to interrupt. That is a deadlock (the
 * reverse order is fine — a sibling created first has already run), documented as
 * misuse — see the transaction README. Detecting it would mean tracking which
 * pending promise a callback is blocked on, which the runner cannot see; a
 * timeout would have to guess at how long a legitimate sibling may run and would
 * abort transactions for being slow. What is cheap and honest is a notice the
 * first time frames actually contend, so the hazard is on the record before it
 * ever hangs.
