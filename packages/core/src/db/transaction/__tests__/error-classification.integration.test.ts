/**
 * Transactional() error classification
 *
 * `Transactional()` catches whatever the handler threw, feeds it to the
 * reconnect trigger, and then decides whether it is a PostgreSQL error worth
 * converting into an SPFN error class. Getting that decision wrong is not a
 * cosmetic bug: `fromPostgresError` answers an unrecognised code with
 * `QueryError 500`, so an application error misrouted into it reaches the
 * client as a bare 500 with its status and its serialized envelope gone.
 *
 * One test per row of the issue-#82 case table, plus the driver's own
 * connection errors (`CONNECTION_CLOSED` and friends), which the table does not
 * list but which still have to convert.
 *
 * Error classes are imported through `@spfn/core/errors` — the same specifier
 * the middleware itself uses — so `instanceof` compares against the same class
 * objects the middleware compared against. A relative `../../errors` import
 * resolves to a second copy of the module and every `instanceof` here would
 * silently answer false.

 *
 * - An `Error` is caught at the frame that threw it. The handler's throw is

 *   the signal `Transactional()` re-throws on — and calls `onError`. The error
 *   `Transactional()` finally re-throws is caught one frame out and calls
 *   `onError` a SECOND time. So `onErrorCalls` is the record of which frames
 *   threw: the first entry is written before `Transactional()`'s catch has even
 *   run, and only the second entry proves the error came back out of it. A test
 *   that looks at `escaped` alone would still pass if the middleware swallowed
 *   the error entirely, because the handler's own frame already wrote it.
 * - A non-`Error` throw is never passed to `onError`; compose re-throws it, so
