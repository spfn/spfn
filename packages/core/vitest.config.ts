/**
 * Default Vitest Configuration (All Tests)
 *
 * Runs all tests (unit + integration) sequentially to avoid memory issues.
 *
 * This is the only config the package has: the separate unit and integration
 * ones were folded into it, and the settings integration tests need — a single
 * fork, no file parallelism, 30s timeouts — apply to every run because of it.
 *
 * For faster feedback during development, the per-module scripts narrow the
 * run to one directory under this same config: pnpm test:logger, test:db, and
 * the rest. The db, cache, and server ones need their infrastructure up.
