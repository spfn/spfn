/**
 * The project's database, asked through the project's own CLI.
 *
 * The asking is done by a child process rather than in this one, and that is
 * the design rather than an accident. Reading a project's migration state
 * means loading that project's environment, and loading it in *this* process
 * would pull the project's secrets — a connection string with a password in it
 * — into the memory of a command that has no use for them and prints reports
 * for a living. A child loads them, answers one question, and exits.
 *
 * The question is asked in the machine-readable form `spfn db status --json`
 * exists for. Nothing here parses prose: a human summary is written to change
 * when it reads better, and a port that depended on its wording would break
 * quietly the first time someone improved it.
