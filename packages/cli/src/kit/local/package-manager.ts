/**
 * The package manager, actually run.
 *
 * "Frozen" is the whole point of this port. A Kit release pins an exact graph
 * in a lockfile, and an install that quietly resolves something newer has
 * produced a project the release never described — so the frozen flag is
 * passed through to pnpm as `--frozen-lockfile`, and a lockfile that no longer
 * matches `package.json` fails the install rather than being rewritten.
 *
 * The registry session never becomes an argument. It goes into the child's
 * environment under one name, and the project's committed `.npmrc` references
 * that name — so the token is in the process's own memory and in no argument
 * list, no file and no log.
 *
 * Why a failure is classified at all: unit 06 lets exactly one failure be
 * retried with a fresh session, and only one. Everything else would fail
 * identically the second time, so telling "the registry refused us" apart from
 * "this graph cannot be resolved" is what keeps the retry meaningful instead of
 * doubling every genuine failure.
