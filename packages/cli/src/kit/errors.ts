/**
 * The machine-readable failure vocabulary of `spfn kit` (unit 06 section 8.3).
 *
 * A Kit command never fails with a stack trace and a number: it fails with a
 * stable code an agent can branch on, and an exit code that says what class of
 * thing went wrong. The two tables below are the whole contract — the code list
 * is closed, and every code maps to exactly one exit code.
 *
 * The codes are the CLI surface of the frozen `kit-error-vocabulary` contract.
 * Adding one here without adding it there would give an agent a code no other
 * repository can read, so the list is asserted against the design in
 * `test/kit/errors.test.ts`.
