/**
 * Making the project's dependency declaration say what the release says, and
 * proving afterwards that the tree agrees.
 *
 * An update changes which versions the release pins. Nothing puts those
 * versions into the project unless something writes them: `package.json` still
 * names the old ones, the lockfile still resolves them, and a frozen install
 * against that lockfile succeeds — installing the previous release perfectly.
 * The Kit lock is then written with the new release number over a `node_modules`
 * that holds the old one, and the update reports success. That failure is
 * silent in every direction, which is why both halves live here:
 *
 *   - `applyManifestVersions` writes the versions, and only for the names the
 *     manifest lists. Unit 05 §6.2 makes `package.json` shared — the Kit owns
 *     its dependency keys and the customer owns everything else in the file —
 *     so a name the manifest does not carry is not touched, and neither is any
 *     other field, key order or formatting;
 *   - `installedGraphMismatches` reads what is actually on disk afterwards. The
 *     registry verification proves the *registry* would serve the right bytes;
 *     this proves the project *has* them.
