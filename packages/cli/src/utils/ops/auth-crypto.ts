/**
 * The `@spfn/auth/crypto` contract, as this CLI needs it
 *
 * SPFN authenticates a request with a JWT the client signs itself, and the two
 * functions below are the client's half of that. They live in `@spfn/auth`,
 * which the CLI does not depend on in any form: an app that does not use auth
 * still uses the rest of the CLI, so the package is resolved at run time from
 * whatever the app has installed, and the version it must be is enforced by the
 * message `loadAuthCrypto` raises rather than by a declared range.
 *
 * The contract is declared here rather than imported, for three reasons that
 * each rule out a dependency of their own:
 *
 * - A workspace dependency closes a cycle — `@spfn/auth` depends on this CLI
 *   for its own codegen — and turbo then refuses to run any task, so the repo
 *   cannot be built or tested at all.
 * - A `peerDependencies` entry, even an optional one, is auto-installed by
 *   pnpm and lands in the lockfile as a **registry** version of a workspace
 *   package. The publish workflows install with `--frozen-lockfile` from public
 *   npmjs, so the lockfile would demand a version that only reaches npmjs
 *   *through those same workflows* — a deadlock on every future `@spfn/auth`
 *   release, not a one-off.
 * - Importing the types would need the package present at compile time, which
 *   is the thing being avoided.
 *
 * So the import specifier is held in a variable, keeping the compiler from
 * resolving a package that is deliberately absent. The shape below is what is
 * promised in exchange; it must keep matching `@spfn/auth/crypto`, and the
 * integration tests in that package walk the real functions end to end.
 *
 * Resolution starts from the app's directory, not from this file. A bare
 * `import('@spfn/auth/crypto')` resolves against the CLI's own location, which
 * is the app only when the CLI happens to be installed inside it — and the
 * documented way to run this CLI is `npx spfn@beta`, which unpacks it into the
 * npx cache instead. From there the walk up the directory tree never reaches
 * the app's `node_modules`, so an app that has `@spfn/auth` installed is told
 * it does not: the operator is sent to install what they already have.
 * `bin/spfn.js` resolves `tsx` the same way for the mirror-image reason.
