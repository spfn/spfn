/**
 * Verified-Email Signup Interceptor
 *
 * Carries the password-setup session between the two browser-facing steps of the
 * verified-email signup, so the secret that authorizes password setup lives in an
 * HttpOnly cookie and never in page script.
 *
 * On the confirm response it moves `setupSecret` out of the body and into the
 * cookie. On the password request it puts the cookie back into the body, the same
 * way `loginRegisterInterceptor` injects a device key. Both interceptors match
 * `/_auth/signup/password` and both run — matching rules execute as a chain in
 * registration order, they do not compete — so the password request arrives with
 * the setup secret and a freshly generated key.
