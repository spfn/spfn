/**
 * CSRF check for cookie-authenticated mutations
 *
 * Enforced here, in the Next.js proxy, because this is the only layer that knows
 * a request's credential was ambient: the browser sends an encrypted HttpOnly
 * session cookie, generalAuthInterceptor turns it into a short-lived bearer JWT,
 * and the backend then sees `scheme:'bearer'` for cookie callers and genuine
 * bearer callers alike. Requests the proxy does not authenticate from the session
 * cookie — no session, direct-to-backend bearer, clientProofV1, machine and ops
 * tokens — never reach this code and are unaffected.
 *
 * The threat model is in the README: the session cookie is SameSite=Lax, so this
 * covers what Lax does not (sibling-subdomain pivots, legacy browsers, domain
 * layout drift) and covers nothing an XSS on your own origin could not do anyway.
