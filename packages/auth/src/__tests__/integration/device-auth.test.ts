/**
 * Device-code login, driven end to end against the mounted auth router.
 *
 * A device with no key on file parks its public key, shows a short code, and
 * polls; the account owner reads that code on a device that is already signed in
 * and approves or denies it. There is no token to hand over — the poll that wins
 * registers the parked key, which is the whole of what "logged in" means here.
 *
 * The cases are the cross of the record's state and the operation applied to it.
 * A spent record answers exactly as one that never existed, so that row is flat;
 * so is the expired row, since a code that sat too long is refused whatever it
 * says.
 *
 * | state ↓ op → | info (userCode) | approve | deny | poll (deviceCode) |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | pending | device details | → approved, userId bound | → denied | `{status:'pending'}` |
 * | approved | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | key registered + → consumed + LoginResult |
 * | denied | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | DeviceAuthDenied |
 * | consumed | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound |
 * | expired (pending/approved/denied) | Expired | Expired | Expired | Expired |
 * | unknown code | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound |
 *
 * The two flat rows overlap in one place — a consumed record that has also
 * expired — and `consumed` wins it. Answering "expired" there would tell the
 * holder of a spent code that it was once real, which is exactly what the
 * identical NotFound exists to prevent; it would just take ten minutes to leak.
 *
 * The expired row is the cross of every state a record can have died in with
 * every operation, not just expired-pending: which refusal a dead code gives
 * must not read out the state it died in.
 *
 * Beyond the table: the consume race, user-code normalization, key material that
 * does not hold together, and the row-level fact that the device code is stored
 * as a hash and not as itself.
 *
 * And three things that live outside the record but decide what it is worth —
 * a global revocation, which has to reach an approval nobody has collected yet;
 * the state of the account behind the approval, which the poll re-checks because
 * it is a login; and the size of what an unauthenticated caller can park in the
 * table, since nothing sweeps it.
