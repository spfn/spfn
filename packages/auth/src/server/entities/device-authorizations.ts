/**
 * @spfn/auth - Device Authorizations Entity
 *
 * Backs device-code login: a device with no key on file yet parks its public key
 * here, shows a short code, and an already-authenticated device approves it. The
 * parked key is registered against the approving user's account when the waiting
 * device polls.
 *
 * The pending key material duplicates the `user_public_keys` columns rather than
 * writing a row there early. A key in `user_public_keys` can sign requests, and
 * nothing about a row here has been approved yet — one table means "registered"
 * and the other means "asked to be", and neither is a state of the other.
 *
 * Nothing sweeps this table. Rows are judged by `expiresAt` on read, so a stale
 * row cannot authorize anything; it only keeps its user code out of circulation,
 * and 31^8 codes do not run out.

 * refusal the waiting device is told about, `consumed` is a completed login that
 * answers as if it never existed. `pending -> approved -> consumed` is the only
 * path to a registered key.
 *
 * `denied` is also where a global revocation puts a record — a revoke-all, a
 * password change, a deletion request — including one already approved. The
 * account has withdrawn it, and what the waiting device is owed for that is the
 * answer a refusal gives.
