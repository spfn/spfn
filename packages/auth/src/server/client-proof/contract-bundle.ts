/**
 * The mobile contract bundle — what spfn-mobile's Swift/Kotlin codegen reads.
 *
 * SPFN primitives owns the contract; this module assembles the bundle so the
 * export is produced here rather than transcribed in the consumer. Two kinds of
 * value go into it:
 *
 * - **Derived.** Operations, wire headers, proof-input fields, replay window,
 *   HTTP statuses and core.time's response shape are read from the modules that
 *   implement them. Changing the server changes the export.
 * - **Declared.** The remaining type shapes, error summaries and prose that
 *   describes canonicalization and admission are written here. No runtime value
 *   carries them. `contract-export.test.ts` runs the real decoders and encoders
 *   against every declaration, so one that stops describing the server fails.

/**
 * The version this export publishes. A mistake becomes a new version.
 *
 * The line is 0.x on purpose. The contract has one consumer, it is still
 * alpha, and its first export shipped a type spelling the consumer could not
 * parse — a surface that green has not earned a stable major. Under 0.x a
 * breaking change is a minor bump, which is what that correction actually was;
 * publishing it as 1.0.1 called a breaking change a patch.
 *
 * 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 existed briefly and are withdrawn. Neither was consumed.
 *
 * 0.2.0 revises the proof mechanism from HMAC-SHA-256 (a shared key) to ECDSA
 * P-256 (a registered public key) — breaking, hence a minor bump, taken while
 * the consumer count is zero. The proof-input, wire headers, admission order
 * and error codes are unchanged.
 *
 * 0.3.0 exports the existing `/_auth` enrollment surface (register, login,
 * native OAuth, key rotation) as contract operations, introduces the unproven
 * operation class (`authProfile: 'none'`), the `boolean` scalar the enrollment
 * responses need, and the key-TTL metadata. A surface addition under 0.x is a
 * minor bump. The clientProofV1 profile itself is unchanged from 0.2.0.
 *
 * 0.3.1 adds the optional `accessToken` field to `OauthNativeRequest`, which
 * Kakao needs to resolve an email claim its id_token omits. A patch, not a
 * minor: nothing existing changes meaning, a generated consumer that never
 * sends the field still matches the server, and the supported range is
 * unchanged — so a consumer pinned at 0.3.0 stays inside it rather than
 * falling out of a range it is in fact still compatible with.
 *
 * 0.4.0 binds `OauthNativeRequest.nonce` to the key being enrolled: it must be
 * the `fingerprint` of the submitted `publicKey`. The field list is untouched,
 * but a consumer that mints a random nonce is now refused, so this is breaking
 * and the range moves with it. Without the binding a valid id_token is enough
 * to enroll any key — the token is bearer-shaped and travels, while the web
 * OAuth flow keeps its key inside CSRF-bound encrypted state.
 *
 * 0.4.1 adds the key-management operations (list, revoke, revoke-all) and the
 * types they carry. A patch: existing operations and types are untouched, and a
 * consumer generated against 0.4.0 keeps matching the server, so the supported
 * range does not move. All three are POST with their arguments in the body —
 * the proof signs body bytes, which have a canonicalization rule, while a value
 * in the path does not.
 *
 * 0.4.2 gives the REST surface a readable failure: every error response now
 * carries the `{"error":{"code","message","requestId"}}` envelope next to the
 * web fields, and `auth.enroll.oauthNative`'s twelve refusals are listed as
 * codes with their status and retryability. A patch: no request or response
 * type moves, and a consumer generated against 0.4.1 could not read these
 * failures at all — it saw one undecodable body whatever went wrong — so
 * nothing it relies on changes and the supported range stays put.
 *
 * 0.5.0 widens the type grammar so an app contract can describe shapes the auth
 * surface never needed — a floating-point `number`, `map<string,T>`, and a named
 * enum whose declaration carries values instead of fields — and states the date
 * convention rather than adding a date scalar: a moment is an integer of
 * milliseconds since the Unix epoch in a field whose name ends `AtMillis`.
 *
 * Widening the grammar alone would have been a patch. What makes this breaking is
 * that `KeySummary` did not follow the convention: `createdAt`, `lastUsedAt`,
 * `expiresAt` and `revokedAt` were ISO 8601 strings, so the same contract stated
 * one representation and shipped two. They are now `createdAtMillis`,
 * `lastUsedAtMillis`, `expiresAtMillis` and `revokedAtMillis` integers, and
 * `listKeys` returns milliseconds.
 *
 * Taken now because the cost only grows: no generated consumer reads these types
 * yet — spfn-mobile's codegen path is unbuilt — and an exception documented
 * instead of removed would have kept Swift's `ISO8601DateFormatter` rejecting
 * fractional seconds as a live way for the two SDKs to disagree, on exactly
 * these four fields. An app reading `createdAt` from `authApi.listKeys()` must
 * move to `createdAtMillis`.
 *
 * 0.6.0 puts the contract version on the wire. A client states its kind, its own
 * release and the contract version it was generated from; the server answers on
 * every response with the version it serves and the range it accepts. A client
 * that ships separately from the server and states no contract version is
 * refused — until now the disagreement surfaced as an undecodable body, which
 * told the user nothing. None of it enters the proof input.
 *
 * `algorithm` becomes the `KeyAlgorithm` enum in the three requests that carry it
 * and in `KeySummary`. The routes have always constrained it to those values while
 * this contract said `string`, so the contract understated the server; it is
 * breaking because it changes what codegen produces for an existing field.
 *
 * The grammar also stops telling a consumer what to do with a value outside a
 * declared set. That was an instruction to the decoder, and a contract states
 * what the server does — how to survive a list that grows is the client's
 * decision to make. No list here is promised to be closed: an algorithm can be
 * withdrawn for a weakness found after this was written, and a contract that
 * promised otherwise would be promising something it cannot keep.
 *
 * 0.6.1 records when each operation became available: every operation now carries
 * `since`, the contract version it first appeared in, backfilled from this
 * repository's own history, and the optional `deprecatedIn` / `removedIn` that a
 * later version will fill in. Nothing is deprecated today, so both are absent
 * everywhere.
 *
 * A patch: no request or response type moves, no operation is added or taken
 * away, and this contract's policy is `allOrNothing`, so the new fields change no
 * verdict — a client is still admitted or refused by one version for the whole
 * surface. They are here so a deprecation has somewhere to be recorded when the
 * first one happens, and so an app contract, which decides per operation, reads
 * availability in the same shape rather than inventing a second one.
 *
 * 0.7.0 removes the `number` scalar and gives the grammar `decimal<scale>`: the
 * wire value is an integer and what it means is that integer divided by 10 to the
 * scale, so `decimal<2>` carries 1999 for 19.99. Canonical JSON does not move —
 * it already admits signed 64-bit integers only and calls a fraction an error,
 * which is what a `number` field would have had to be written as. The grammar and
 * the encoding had been stating different things, and only the encoding ran.
 *
 * Two rules ride the spelling. The scale is part of the type, so changing it is
 * breaking and takes a version bump, and the field is renamed to carry its new
 * unit rather than be quietly remeasured under the old name — the same reasoning
 * that put `AtMillis` in the name of every moment here. And a generator emits a
 * decimal type — Swift `Decimal`, Kotlin `BigDecimal` — never a binary float, and
 * rejects a value finer than the declared scale at encoding time instead of
 * rounding it, because rounding lets the client decide what a value the server
 * declared exactly is worth.
 *
 * Breaking because a declared scalar is gone. A consumer generated against 0.6.x
 * that meets `decimal<2>` fails at generation time, which is what this grammar's
 * own rule asks for — an unknown spelling is a contract error, not something to
 * guess at. Nothing deployed breaks: no type in this contract used `number`, so
 * the removal has zero usages, and it is taken now because the alternative is
 * carrying a scalar the encoding refuses until something depends on it.
 *
 * 0.8.0 applies to the error envelope the rule 0.6.0 applied to the grammar.
 * `unknownCodePolicy: 'reject'` and the rule beside it told a decoder what to do
 * with a code this bundle does not list, and `additionalFields` told it to ignore
 * the extra top-level fields rather than reject them. The test is whether the
 * server would notice a client doing the opposite, and it would not. Both are
 * replaced by the fact behind them: the server sends codes outside the list, and
 * the body carries fields beside the error object. Breaking, because removing a
 * declaration changes what a generated consumer is built from.
 *
 * 0.9.0 imports core.time as the bodyless, unproven prerequisite a client uses
 * to establish the server epoch before minting its first proof in a process.
 * It also states fail-closed behavior when synchronization is unavailable and
 * pins all four time-admission boundaries. Breaking because operation request
 * types were previously mandatory and every generated call therefore carried a
 * body; the supported range moves so an older generator cannot guess at GET.
 *
 * 0.10.0 puts device-code login in the contract: the five `/_auth/device/*`
 * operations, the types they carry, the `DeviceAuthPollStatus` discriminant and
 * the four device refusals. A phone runs both sides of that flow — it is the
 * natural approver, and it may equally be the device asking to be let in — so
 * all five are exported and not only the approver's three. The operations
 * themselves are additive, the way 0.4.1's key management was.
 *
 * What makes it a minor is `auth.device.deny`. It answers 204 with an empty
 * body, so `responseType` becomes optional exactly as `requestType` did in
 * 0.9.0, and for the same reason: a consumer generated against 0.9.x reads a
 * response type on every operation and would have to guess what deny answers
 * with. The range moves so it is refused CONTRACT_UNSUPPORTED instead of
 * guessing.
 *
 * The poll answer is a union on the wire — still waiting, or the login an
 * approval produced — and this grammar has no union type. It is exported as one
 * type whose `status` is a required enum and whose every other field is
 * optional, which is what the wire actually shows. `deviceAuthorization` states
 * which fields belong to which status, and that a pending answer is a 200 and
 * never a refusal: a client that read pending as an error would stop waiting at
 * the one moment the flow asks it to keep waiting.
 *
 * `platform` becomes the `KeyPlatform` enum wherever it appears — the two device
 * types that carry it and `KeySummary` with them. The routes have only ever
 * accepted the four values `KEY_PLATFORM` lists, and the columns store nothing
 * else, so `string` understated the server in exactly the way `algorithm` did
 * before 0.6.0. It rides this version because it changes what codegen produces
 * for an existing field, which is breaking on its own, and 0.10.0 is where the
 * break already is.
