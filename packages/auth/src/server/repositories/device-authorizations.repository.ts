/**
 * Device Authorizations Repository
 *
 * Data access for device-code login. Extends BaseRepository for transaction
 * context detection and read/write splitting.
 *
 * Every state change here is a conditional UPDATE naming the exact state it is
 * allowed to move from, returning the row only when THIS call was the one that
 * moved it. That is what makes the operations safe to race: two polls on one
 * approved record, or a deny arriving while an approve is in flight, produce one
 * winner and one refusal instead of both callers acting on a row they each read
 * as still theirs to move. Read-then-write would lose that.
 *
 * Each of those transitions also carries the TTL, as `now()` evaluated by the
 * database. The service reads a record before it acts on it, and a record can
 * pass its expiry in the gap between that read and this UPDATE — an approved one
 * most of all, since the poll that spends it is the one call that registers a
 * key. Judging the clock only in the read would let that key be registered after
 * the code was dead.
