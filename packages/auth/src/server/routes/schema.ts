/**
 * Key material as a device sends it, bounded.
 *
 * The bounds exist for the one route that takes this material from a caller who
 * has not authenticated and cannot: `POST /_auth/device/start` persists what it
 * is given, and a correctly fingerprinted megabyte of base64 would sit in
 * `device_authorizations` until something swept it — and nothing sweeps it.
 *
 * The numbers are what real key material measures, with room to spare. The
 * package's own generators produce SPKI DER in base64: 124 characters for
 * ES256 (P-256), 392 for RS256 (RSA-2048). An RSA-4096 key would be 736, an
 * RSA-8192 key about 1400, and the same 4096-bit key PEM-armoured about 800 —
 * so 2048 admits every shape of key anyone could reasonably present, while a
 * megabyte is refused three orders of magnitude before it reaches a row.
 *
 * `keyId` is a UUID (36) everywhere this package generates one; 64 leaves room
 * for a client that prefixes or namespaces its own. `fingerprint` is SHA-256
 * hex, exactly 64, and nothing else can ever verify against the public key —
 * 128 is the length a longer digest would need, and no more.

/**
 * What `POST /_auth/device/poll` answers with.
 *
 * A union, because the two answers are different kinds of thing rather than one
 * shape with optional fields: pending says "ask again in this long", approved is
 * a completed login carrying exactly what `/_auth/login` returns. `status` is the
 * discriminant, so a generated client narrows on it instead of testing which
 * fields happen to be present.
 *
 * The mobile contract has no union type, so it exports this as one object with
 * `status` required and every branch field optional — see
 * `deviceAuthorization.pollStatusRule` in the bundle. `intervalMillis` is an
 * integer for the same reason: that grammar carries no floating-point scalar,
 * and a count of milliseconds never needed one.
 *
 * That integer is a promise two things keep, because nothing validates a response
 * against this schema on the way out. `configureDeviceAuth` refuses an interval
 * that is not a whole number of milliseconds, so the only value this branch can
 * carry is one; and `contract-export.test.ts` reads this schema to check the
 * exported declaration, so writing `Type.Number` here fails the suite instead of
 * publishing an integer the server does not send.
