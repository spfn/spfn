/**
 * @spfn/auth - One route, two credentials
 *
 * An operator action is scripted today (the CLI, holding an ops token) and
 * driven from an admin console tomorrow (a browser, holding a user session).
 * That is one route with two admissible credentials, and neither existing
 * middleware admits both: `authenticate` refuses an `spfn_ops_` bearer before
 * any scope guard runs (#79 — the user path never admits a machine
 * credential), and `opsTokenAuth` admits nothing else. `opsOrUser` composes
 * the two existing pairs behind one middleware so an application does not
 * hand-write the branch.
 *
 * The rules it keeps:
 *
 * - **The branch is chosen by credential shape, never by caller choice.** The
 *   raw `Authorization` bearer is tested with `isOpsToken`; a match takes the
 *   ops branch, everything else (user JWT, another machine namespace,
 *   malformed, absent) takes the user branch. A caller cannot select the
 *   weaker check by asking for it, because nothing in the request selects a
 *   branch except the credential it presents.
 * - **`roles` and `permissions` are AND, roles first.** Two lists only ever
 *   narrow. An OR would mean one added role voids the whole permission list,
 *   which is the opposite of what a reader of the two lists expects. Roles run
 *   first because the role is already on the auth context while permissions
 *   cost a lookup — and so a caller with the wrong role is refused for the
 *   wrong role.
 * - **No implicit admin bypass.** Permissions match by name only, and the ops
 *   branch has no role concept, so neither branch has a principal that passes
 *   by virtue of being an administrator.
 * - **A refusal is the selected branch's own refusal.** No error class and no
 *   wire message is introduced here; whichever guard refused answers exactly
 *   what it answers on a single-credential route.
 * - **It is a `NamedMiddleware`, not a `defineMiddleware` factory.** A factory
 *   produces a bare handler, and `register-routes` reads `skips` only off a
 *   `NamedMiddleware` object — so a factory form would put `.skip(['auth'])`
 *   back on every route, which is the hand-written workaround this exists to
 *   remove. Carrying `skips: ['auth']` makes the global `auth` middleware
 *   auto-skip, exactly as `optionalAuth` and `opsTokenAuth` do.
 *
 * The backend never reads cookies. A browser session reaches here as a Bearer
 * token because `@spfn/auth/nextjs/api` forwards it as one; a request carrying
 * only a `Cookie` header is an unauthenticated request on this route.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { opsOrUser } from '@spfn/auth/server';
 *
 * export const exportSignups = route.get('/admin/signups/export')
 *     .use([opsOrUser({ opsScopes: ['waitlist:read'], permissions: ['admin.waitlist'] })])
 *     .handler(async (c) =>
 *     {
 *         // exactly one of these is set
 *         const ops = getOpsToken(c.raw);
 *         const user = getAuth(c.raw);
 *     });
 * ```
