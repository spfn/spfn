/**
 * The auth-profile registry the authenticate middleware dispatches on.
 *
 * A request that names `x-spfn-auth-profile` is answered by the verifier
 * registered for that profile — an O(1) map lookup, never a per-profile if
 * chain in the middleware body. A request that names no profile falls through
 * to the existing Bearer path untouched.
 *
 * Every verifier converges on the same `AuthContext` the Bearer path sets, so
 * downstream permission/tenant code consumes one principal shape and never
 * branches on how it was authenticated.
 *
 * An app adds its own scheme with `registerAuthProfile` at boot. The dispatch
 * it joins is the one below, unchanged: a name nobody registered is still
 * refused, and profile credentials mixed with an Authorization header are
 * still refused before either path runs.
 *
 * The clientProofV1 verifier reuses the phase-1 admission pieces (header
 * shape, canonical body, proof-input assembly, ECDSA verification) with two
 * production substitutions: the key directory is `user_public_keys` via
 * `keysRepository`, and the replay ledger is the pluggable store from
 * `client-proof/replay-store` (memory default, Redis opt-in). The admission
 * order is the contract's — revocation → session → expiry → replay → proof —
 * and the non-disclosure rule holds: an unregistered keyId shares
 * PROOF_INVALID with a failed signature, while a revoked or expired key
 * answers SESSION_REVOKED before the proof is ever examined.
