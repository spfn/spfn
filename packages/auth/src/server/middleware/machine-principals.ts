/**
 * The machine-principal registry `machineAuth` dispatches on (#79).
 *
 * A machine credential is issued by a service to a non-interactive process and
 * its subject is an account or a tenant, not a person. Two things follow, and
 * both are structural here rather than a rule someone has to remember:
 *
 * A machine principal never enters `AuthContext`. It lives in its own context
 * key (`machinePrincipal`), is read by its own helper (`getMachinePrincipal`),
 * and is admitted by its own middleware. `getAuth(c)` keeps returning users
 * only, so a machine request cannot impersonate a user session — there is no
 * code path that would put it there. This generalizes `opsTokenAuth`, which is
 * the same shape hand-written for one credential (and which keeps its own
 * context key; it is not implemented on this registry).
 *
 * Ownership is not authentication. Who issued a machine token, and who may
 * revoke or audit it, is the registrant's data-level concern. What the request
 * acts as is the token's own subject and scopes, and nothing resolves a machine
 * subject to a user.
 *
 * Discrimination is by registered prefix — a raw `tokenPrefix` for opaque
 * secrets (the `spfn_ops_` shape) or a `kidPrefix` on the JOSE header of a JWS
 * (the `machine:runtime:` shape). Conflicts are refused at registration, so
 * first-match ambiguity is impossible by construction rather than resolved per
 * request. `authenticate` and `optionalAuth` consult the same discriminators to
 * refuse a machine credential before the user path examines it.
 *
 * Registration is a boot-time API. The registry is module state read on every
 * dispatch, so a verifier registered after requests started is simply a
 * verifier the requests before it did not have — the same contract
 * `registerAuthProfile` states, and for the same reason: an auth surface that
 * can be rearranged at runtime is a surface an app bug can rearrange. There is
 * no unregistration and no reset.
