/**
 * @spfn/auth - Device Auth Service
 *
 * Device-code login: a device with no key on file yet shows a short code, the
 * account owner types that code on a device that is already signed in, and the
 * waiting device's key is registered on approval.
 *
 * There is no token to hand over. Every request in this system is signed by the
 * calling device's own key, so "logging a device in" means one thing — getting
 * its public key into `user_public_keys` under the right account. That is what
 * the poll does, and it is why the poll returns exactly what `loginService`
 * returns: from the client's side the two ways in are indistinguishable.
 *
 * | state ↓ op → | info | approve | deny | poll |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | pending | device details | → approved | → denied | pending |
 * | approved | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | key registered, → consumed |
 * | denied | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | AlreadyHandled | Denied |
 * | consumed | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound |
 * | expired | Expired | Expired | Expired | Expired |
 * | unknown | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound | NotFound |
 *
 * A global revocation — revoke-all, a password change, a deletion request —
 * refuses the account's live records too, as `denied`, so they land in that row
 * of the table. See `denyAllActiveByUserId`; the three callers are the three
 * places that revoke every key at once.
