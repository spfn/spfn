# SPFN Cloud Platform - Deployment & Business Strategy

## Overview

SPFN Cloud Platform 배포 전략, 운영 계획, 수익모델 설계

## Current State

### Infrastructure ✅
- Kubernetes cluster with Woodpecker CI/CD
- Automatic deployment from Git push
- Dual domain architecture (subdomain.spfn.app + api-subdomain.spfn.app)
- Environment variables injection from spfn.config.js
- Custom domain support

### Configuration ✅
- `spfn.config.js` with JSDoc type hints
- Type-safe configuration with TypeScript definitions
- Package manager selection
- Environment variables management

## Tasks

### 1. Platform Strategy & Business Model
- [ ] Define pricing tiers (Free/Hobby/Pro/Enterprise)
- [ ] Resource allocation per tier (CPU, Memory, Storage)
- [ ] Database connection limits per tier
- [ ] API rate limiting strategy
- [ ] Bandwidth limits and overage pricing
- [ ] Free tier limitations (sleep after inactivity?)
- [ ] Competitor analysis (Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly.io)

### 2. Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Create `/docs/deployment` page on landing site
- [ ] Document spfn.config.js configuration
- [ ] Explain dual domain architecture
- [ ] Custom domain setup guide (DNS configuration)
- [ ] Environment variables best practices
- [ ] Secrets management guidelines
- [ ] GitHub integration setup

### 3. Platform Features to Implement
- [ ] User authentication and project ownership
- [ ] Dashboard for project management
- [ ] Real-time deployment logs
- [ ] Deployment history and rollback
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Billing and payment integration
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Custom domain verification
- [ ] SSL certificate management

### 4. Resource Management System
- [ ] Design resource quota system
- [ ] Implement resource monitoring
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Container orchestration improvements

### 5. Developer Experience
- [ ] CLI command for deployment: `spfn deploy`
- [ ] Deployment preview for PRs
- [ ] Environment management (staging/production)
- [ ] One-click rollback
- [ ] Deployment webhooks
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Actions

### 6. Operations & Monitoring
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry integration?)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery

### 7. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy
- [ ] SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- [ ] GDPR compliance
- [ ] Data retention policy

## Revenue Model Ideas

### Option 1: Usage-Based Pricing (Vercel Style)
- Free tier with limits
- Pay for what you use (compute time, bandwidth, build minutes)
- Simple and transparent

### Option 2: Tier-Based Pricing (Heroku Style)
- Fixed monthly prices per tier
- Predictable costs for users
- Clear feature differentiation

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Railway Style)
- Free credits monthly
- Usage-based overages
- Best of both worlds
